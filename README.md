# DPRK_provocations_ObamaVSTrump
 BACKGROUD:
 Trump touts his foreing policy on North Korea as his administration's key achievement, downplaying Obama's so-called strategic pateince stance agianst North Korea. 
 Has Trump's direct engagement with Kim Jung Eun brought peace to the Korean peninsula? If so, can we attribute the peace to Trump's policy? If not, did Obama fail?
 
 Aim:
 (1) plot of the number of North Korean Provocations during the Obama and Trump administration
 (2) provide a visualisation of the crude comparison between two administrations  
 (3) this will serve as prelliminary data, although insufficient, to help assess the two US administration's effort to contain the peninisula risk
